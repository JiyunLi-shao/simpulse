simpulse: a C++/python library for simulating FRB's and pulsars.

Documentation here: [https://kmsmith137.github.io/simpulse_docs/](https://kmsmith137.github.io/simpulse_docs/).

It is not designed for speed, but simulates pulses very accurately, keeping track of 
effects such as dispersion smearing within frequency channels, or finite time sampling artifacts.

Currently, simpulse makes two-dimensional simulations of FRB's (where the axes are frequency and time),
and one-dimensional simulations of pulsars (where the axis is time).  Two-dimensional pulsar simulations
are coming soon!

Source code for the documentation is in its own git repository
[https://github.com/kmsmith137/simpulse_docs](https://github.com/kmsmith137/simpulse_docs),
in order to avoid bloating the "code" repository with image files, fonts, etc.
You only need to clone the "documentation" repository if you want to modify the online documentation,
or build your own local copy of the documentation.
